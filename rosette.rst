CTD and Rosette Setup
=====================

For |CRS| a :term:`SIO` :term:`STS` 36-place yellow rosette and bottles were used.
The rosette was sent to Guam in early January, 2022.
The rosette and bottles were built before P06 2017, making this the thirteenth time this package has been deployed.
A steel bridle was added to the top of the rosette to adapt to the winch head.
The bottles were made with new PVC, with new non-baked o-rings and electro-polished steel springs.
Springs within the Bullister-style Niskin bottles were electropolished stainless steel.
Bottle lanyards were made from 300-pound monofilament.
No sample contamination has been noticed by the change in o-rings and springs.
The package used on |CRS| weighs roughly 1500 lbs in air without water and 2350 lbs in air with water.
The package used on |CRS| weighs roughly 950 lbs in water.
In addition to the standard :term:`CTDO` package on GO-SHIP cruises three chipods, two :term:`LADCP`, and one :term:`UVP` were mounted on the rosette.

During the cruise we encountered a handful of problems, most notably noise between the primary and secondary CTD lines.
We describe all of the above in more detail in the sections below.

Underwater Sampling Package
---------------------------

|PACK| casts were performed with a package consisting of a 36 bottle rosette frame, a 36-place carousel and 36 Bullister style Niskin bottles with an absolute volume of 10.6 L.
Underwater electronic components primarily consisted of a SeaBird Electronics housing unit with Paroscientific pressure sensor with dual plumbed lines where each line has a pump, temperature sensor, conductivity sensor, and exhaust line.
A SeaBird Electronics membrane oxygen sensor was mounted on the "primary" line.
A reference thermometer, RINKO oxygen optode, transmissometer, chlorophyll-a fluorometer, and altimeter were also mounted on the rosette.
Chipod, LADCP, and UVP instruments were deployed with the CTD/rosette package and their use is outlined in sections of this document specific to their titled analysis.

CTD and cage were horizontally mounted at the bottom of the rosette frame, located below the carousel for all stations.
The temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, respective pumps and exhaust tubing was mounted to the CTD and cage housing as recommended by SBE.
The reference temperature sensor was mounted between the primary and secondary temperature sensors at the same level as the intakes for the pumped temperature sensors.
The transmissometer was mounted horizontally on the lower LADCP brace with hose clamps, avoiding shiny metal inside that would introduce noise in the signal.
The hose clamps for the transmissometer were covered in black electrical tape.
The oxygen optode, fluorometer, and altimeter were mounted vertically inside the bottom ring of the rosette frames, with nothing obstructing their line of sight.
One 300 KHz bi-directional Broadband LADCP (RDI) unit was mounted vertically on the bottom side of the frame.
Another 300 KHz bi-directional Broadband LADCP (RDI) unit was mounted vertically on the top side of the frame.
The LADCP battery pack was also mounted on the bottom of the frame.
The LADCP and LADCP battery pack were mounted near (90Â°) each other at the beginning of the cruise.
Imagining the now of the ship to be north, the LADCP battery was mounted on the south side of the rosette, the up/down LADCPs were on the west side, the UVP on the east, and CTD mounted to the north.

Winch and Deployment
--------------------
The CAST6 winch and deployment system was used for all stations.
The rosette system was suspended from a UNOLS-standard three-conductor 0.322" electro-mechanical sea cable.
The sea cable was terminated with an Evergrip (primary), Guy Grip (secondary), and set of Crosby Clips (tertiary).
No electrical issues occurred on P02.
There were continuous issues with wire twist and had to "move up" the termination 3 times during the cruise.

The deck watch prepared the rosette 10-30 minutes prior to each cast.
The bottles were cocked and all valves, vents, and lanyards were checked for proper orientation.
Any biofouling noted was cleaned off the outside of the rosette before the next cast, and the inside of the bottles were checked for biofouling and sprayed down.
LADCP technician would check for LADCP battery charge, prepare instrument for data acquisition, and disconnect cables.
Once stopped on station, the Marine Technician would check the sea state prior to cast and decide if conditions were acceptable for deployment.
The rosette was moved from the sampling bay out to the deck using the *Revelle's* tugger-driven cart.
Once on deck, sea cable slack was pulled up by the winch operator.
CTD watch standers would then turn on the deckbox and begin data acquistion, and the cast would begin.
Recovering the package at the end of the deployment was the reverse of launching.
Once rolled back into the sampling bay, a technician secured the cart to the deck using additional ratchet straps.
The carousel was rinsed and sensors were cleaned (as described below) after every cast, and then samplers were allowed to begin collecting water.

Maintenance and Calibrations
----------------------------

During |CRS| routine maintenance was done to the rosette to ensure quality of the science done.
Actions taken included rinsing all electrical instruments on the rosette down with fresh water after each cast and adjusting hose clamps and guide rings as needed such that lanyards had appropriate tension.
Care was taken not to rinse the spigots and other parts of the bottle that might be touched by samplers in order to not contaminate the samples.
After each cast, syringes of fresh water were connected to the plumbed lines to rinse the sensors and allow them to soak between casts.
While in freezing conditions, water was drained after rinse to avoid freezing in the plumbing.
Overhead heaters recently installed on the Thompson were run while in freezing or near-freezing conditions.
The rosette was routinely examined for valve and o-ring leaks, which were maintained as needed.
SBE35RT temperature data was routinely downloaded each day.

Every 20 stations, the transmissometer windows were cleaned and on deck blocked and un-blocked voltage readings were recorded prior to the cast.
The transmissometer was also calibrated before the start and after the end of science operations.

Logs
----
In port: Preparation of the CTD and rosette was minimal as it had nearly the same setup as A20 2021, which had just been completed.
UVP arrived in St. Thomas and was mounted opposite the ADCP.
Downlooking chipod mounting pole was swapped out to allow the sensor to be closer to the leading edge of the rosette.
Additional integrity checks on the rosette, such as checking lanyard angles, o-ring and lanyard replacement, and spigot movement waited until being underway to be checked as lower priority tasks.
We are using a new mounting system for the downward looking LADCP which has the LADCP clamped facing inward instead of outward, which will cause problems if we need to change that LADCP in rough weather.

Sensor Problems
---------------

*T,C offsets*: During 20 m soak, sensor offsets in primary and secondary lines (T2 - T1, C2 - C1) were noisy or spiky following station 32. This was occasionally exacerbated by ship heave within a steep density gradient.

*SBE43*: SBE43 |O2| was consistently noisy at depths of 800 m or greater on downcasts and upcasts following station 32. This improved around station 104, where the height of the secondary pump was lowered.
