CTD and Rosette Setup
=====================

For |CRS| the new STS 36 place yellow rosette and bottles, built in 2017, were used.
The rosette and bottles were built before P06 2017, making this the seventh time this package has been deployed.
The bottles were made with new PVC, with new non-baked o-rings and electro-polished steel springs.
This represents a change from the past, where on GO-SHIP cruises using ODF equipment before P06 2017 o-rings were baked for 3 days at 100Â°C at 1-3 Torr in a sweeper gas of hydrogen.
Springs used to be painted and Tygon tubing added to the ends to prevent paint wearing away from bottle firing.
As on P06 2017 no sample contamination has been noticed by the change in o-rings and springs.
The package used on |CRS| weighs roughly 1500 lbs in air without water, and 2350 lbs in air with water.
The package used on |CRS| weighs roughly 950 lbs in water.
In addition to the standard CTDO package on GO-SHIP cruises three chipods, two LADCPs, and one experimental CTD were mounted on the rosette.
During the cruise we encountered a handful of problems, most notably noisy altimeter data and bottle firing issues.
We describe all of the above in more detail in the sections below.

Underwater Sampling Package
---------------------------

|PACK| casts were performed with a package consisting of a 36 bottle rosette frame, a 36-place carousel and 36 Bullister style Niskin bottles with an absolute volume of 10.6L.
Underwater electronic components primarily consisted of a SeaBird Electronics housing unit with Paroscientific pressure sensor with dual plumbed lines where each line has a pump, temperature sensor, conductivity sensor, and exhaust line.
A SeaBird Electronics membrane oxygen sensor was mounted on the "primary" line.
A reference thermometer, Rinko oxygen optode, transmissometer, chlorophyll-a fluorometer, and altimeter were also mounted on the rosette.
Chipod, LADCP, and UVP instruments were deployed with the CTD/rosette package and their use is outlined in sections of this document specific to their titled analysis.

CTD and cage were horizontally mounted at the bottom of the rosette frame, located below the carousel for all stations.
The temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, respective pumps and exhaust tubing was mounted to the CTD and cage housing as recommended by SBE.
The reference temperature sensor was mounted between the primary and secondary temperature sensors at the same level as the intake tubes for the exhaust lines.
The transmissometer was mounted horizontally on the lower LADCP brace with hose clamps around both of its ends, avoiding shiny metal or black tape inside that would introduce noise in the signal.
The oxygen optode, fluorometer, and altimeter were mounted vertically inside the bottom ring of the rosette frames, with nothing obstructing their line of sight.
One 300 KHz bi-directional Broadband LADCP (RDI) unit was mounted vertically on the bottom side of the frame.
Another 300 KHz bi-directional Broadband LADCP (RDI) unit was mounted vertically on the top side of the frame.
The LADCP battery pack was also mounted on the bottom of the frame.
The LADCP and LADCP battery pack were mounted next to each other at the beginning of the cruise.
If we imagine the LADCP battery being north on the rosette, the LADCP was mounted east, the CTD mounted south, and the UVP mounted west.

Winch and Deployment
--------------------
The aft DESH-5 winch deployment system was used for all stations.
The rosette system was suspended from a UNOLS-standard three-conductor 0.322" electro-mechanical sea cable.
The sea cable was already terminated from the previous leg (A20) and no electrical or mechanical issues occurred on A22.

The deck watch prepared the rosette 10-30 minutes prior to each cast.
The bottles were cocked and all valves, vents, and lanyards were checked for proper orientation.
Any biofouling noted was cleaned off the outside of the rosette before the next cast, and the inside of the bottles were checked for biofouling and sprayed down.
LADCP technician would check for LADCP battery charge, prepare instrument for data acquisition, and disconnect cables.
Once stopped on station, the Marine Technician would check the sea state prior to cast and decide if conditions were acceptable for deployment.
The rosette was moved from the sampling bay out to the deck using the Thompson's new winch-driven cart.
Once on deck, the ratchet straps connecting the rosette to the cart were removed and sea cable slack was pulled up by the winch operator.
CTD watch standers would then turn on the deckbox and begin data acquistion, and the cast would begin.
Recovering the package at the end of the deployment was the reverse of launching.
Once rolled back into the sampling bay, the ship crew secured the cart to the deck using additional ratchet straps.
The carousel was rinsed and sensors were cleaned (as described below) after every cast, and then samplers were allowed to begin collecting water.

Maintenance and Calibrations
----------------------------

During |CRS| routine maintenance was done to the rosette to ensure quality of the science done.
Actions taken included rinsing all electrical instruments on the rosette down with fresh water after each cast and adjusting hose clamps and guide rings as needed such that lanyards had appropriate tension.
Care was taken not to rinse the spigots and other parts of the bottle that might be touched by samplers in order to not contaminate the samples.
After each cast, syringes of fresh water were connected to the plumbed lines to rinse the sensors and allow them to soak between casts.
While in freezing conditions, water was drained after rinse to avoid freezing in the plumbing.
Overhead heaters recently installed on the Thompson were run while in freezing or near-freezing conditions.
The rosette was routinely examined for valve and o-ring leaks, which were maintained as needed.
SBE35RT temperature data was routinely downloaded each day.

Every 20 stations, the transmissometer windows were cleaned and on deck blocked and un-blocked voltage readings were recorded prior to the cast.
The transmissometer was also calibrated before the start and after the end of science operations.

Logs
----
In port: Preparation of the CTD and rosette was minimal as it had nearly the same setup as A20 2021, which had just been completed.
UVP arrived in St. Thomas and was mounted opposite the ADCP.
Downlooking chipod mounting pole was swapped out to allow the sensor to be closer to the leading edge of the rosette.
Additional integrity checks on the rosette, such as checking lanyard angles, o-ring and lanyard replacement, and spigot movement waited until being underway to be checked as lower priority tasks.
We are using a new mounting system for the downward looking LADCP which has the LADCP clamped facing inward instead of outward, which will cause problems if we need to change that LADCP in rough weather.

Sensor Problems
---------------

*T,C offsets*: During 20 m soak, sensor offsets in primary and secondary lines (T2 - T1, C2 - C1) were noisy or spiky following station 32.

*SBE43*: SBE43 |O2| was consistently noisy at depths of 800 m or greater on downcasts and upcasts following station 32.

*Bottle guide rings*: Guide rings continually slipped during the whole cruise. In the end, the issue was they were not being sufficiently tightened by the normal drill we used â fixed by hand tightening further with screwdriver.
