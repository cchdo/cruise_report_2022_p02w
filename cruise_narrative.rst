Cruise Narrative
================

The 2022 re-occupation of P02 along 30Â°N in the Pacific was defined by a week-long delay, a quick start, a well-defined crossing of the Kuroshio and then its large loop, deep western casts including the Izu-Ogasawara Trench, and except for one post-Kuroshio wire re-termination, supported by a nearly continuous spell of calm weather and seas, no interruption to routine deployments and recoveries.
Technical difficulties were generally minimal and short lived.

Quarantine, Delay and Transit
--------------------------------------

Most of the science party arrived in Guam by evening of April 9, glad to have the 20+ hours of masked flying time over.
One person was unable to come due to a last-minute family emergency.
A series of fortunate events led us to an eager young marine biologist from the University of Guam, who was willing to drop everything to join our Bio GO-SHIP team in the P02 pilot project that would include both bio-only casts and multiple underway measurements.
We settled into quarantine by noon on the 11th.
Amazingly, we managed to get 90% of our assorted multi-disciplinary/institutional/generational group to book rooms in the same hotel.
This has allowed us (our co-chief Shuwen Tan did all the leg work) to set up group PCR testing prior to boarding without the necessity of leaving the hotel.

Most of the pre-cruise logistical issues revolved around a lack of cargo flights from Honolulu the week prior to our load.
While most were sorted out prior to the original departure date (April 22), part of the CFC shipment was delayed until the day before our final departure of April 30).

One item of note is that on one of the cruises out Guam earlier this year a rosette was lost.
However, after a thorough investigation and the setting up of new protocols and safety features, we were confident that our GO-SHIP 36-bottle rosette would not suffer the same fate. 

While in quarantine we continued to follow the behavior of the Kuroshio as this would affect our final station plan (Fig. 1).
We held daily virtual meetings with the students and held non-required all-hands meetings (check in was required).
Our student led GO-SHIP/GO-BGC blog (can be accessed through either https://usgoship.ucsd.edu/blogs/ or https://www.go-bgc.org/expedition/north-pacific-2022/) and weekly reports (https://usgoship.ucsd.edu/2022/04/16/weekly-reports-from-2022-p02-leg-1/) were started.

    Symbols represent station locations: Full-depth casts (red circles), with Bio 1000 m casts (red crosses), with GO-BGC float deployments (red "x"s).
    The green star represents the location of Station 11.
    Arrows represent the estimate of surface velocity from the Copernicus physical model for 5/07/22 12:00 UTC, the color shading indicates the amplitude of the surface velocity.

After 7 days in COVID quarantine (April 11-17), the science party boarded the R/V Revelle for MOB (April 18-22) with the intention of departing on April 22 at 16:00 (local, 10 hours ahead of UTC).
However, due to the ship's inability to hire a key member of the engineering department, the ship did not depart until 10:00 (local) on April 30th.
As we could not leave the ship, our time was well spent setting up and for the students, learning about the equipment, waiting and dealing with the shipment delays, creating a new bracket for the ODF rosette so that the upward-looking LADCP could sit above the bottles and not be crushed by the CAST-6 (Fig. 2), and decorating the floats for schools which had adopted them.
The R/V Revelle left the dock at 10:00 (local) on April 30.
Once out of the Navy Harbor, we picked up two of our science party (who had not been able to gain access to the Navy Base) via launch before heading out into open waters.
