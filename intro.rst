GO-SHIP P02 2022 Hydrographic Program
======================================

Cruise Scientific Objectives
----------------------------

The P02W 2022 cruise aboard the UNOLS vessel R/V *Roger Revelle* was undertaken as part of the US GO-SHIP (Global Ocean Ship-based Hydrographic Investigations Program).
The program's overall objective is to collect quasi-decadal, highly accurate, surface-to-bottom, coast-to-coast, physical, and chemical oceanic observations. 
These measurements are essential to monitoring long-term changes in heat, freshwater, carbon, oxygen, and other tracers in the global ocean - the main reservoir in the Earth System. 

The P02W transit follows the 30th parallel in the North Pacific.
This year, the P02W worked from the coast of Japan to the Musician's Seamounts north of Hawaii, hugging as closely to 30Â°N as possible.


In 2022, 148 CTD/LADCP/rosette/bio casts were performed between May 2 and June 8.
116 complete casts were taken as full casts, including a suite of Niskin bottle sample analyses.
32 casts were reserved for bio to collect large volumes of water.
