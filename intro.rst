GO-SHIP P02 2022 Hydrographic Program
======================================

Summary
----------------------------

The Leg 1 2022 reoccupation of the GO-SHIP P02 hydrographic line, RR2204 (Fig. 1) included 117 stations using a 36-bottle rosette: One station (Sta 1, 21.000°N, 140.050°E) along the transit from Guam at which core/bio [1]_ measurements were acquired between 1500/1000 m and the surface in support of a GO-BGC Argo float deployment; A single underway HPLC sample in support of a second float deployment (Sta 2, 26.670°N, 137.080°E); full water column core sampling at 12 stations from 32.507°N, 133.030°E to 30.000°N, 134.860°E, and 103 stations eastward along  30°N to 198.786°E.
Biology samples were obtained approximately every third station.
In all, 10 GO-BGC floats were deployed - all (except the underway Sta 2 float) were supported by both core and bio sampling.

	Black crosses - for P02 2022 station locations; green crosses - stations that included bio-only bottles and/or casts, cyan asterisks - GO-BGC float deployments; purple dots - departure (Guam, Navy Base) and arrival (University of Hawaii Pier, Honolulu) ports; and blue shading - 1 minute Smith and Sandwell bathymetry.
	
The planned station spacing included very close spacing down the Japan coast and across the region of the Kuroshio its large loop and generally 30 nm spacing across the rest of the section.
The delay at the start and a limited allowed time in the Japan EEZ led to a reduced number of stations in the west (9 vs. 15 coming south to 30°N, 23 vs. 33 in the Japan EEZ, and 46 vs. 59 west of 159°E where in 2022 30 nm spacing was resumed).
The planned 131 stations were reduced to 117, but with fantastic weather and seas, Leg 1 finished only 1° west of the original longitudinal goal.

The rosette instruments included dual CTDs, one with oxygen (SBE43), a secondary separate RINKO oxygen sensor, fluorometer, transmissometer, upward and downward-looking LADCPs an underwater vision profiler (UVP), two upward-looking and one downward-looking Chi-POD.
All 10 GO_BGC floats deployed had biochemical sensors.
Along all transits, including those in Japanese waters, continuous underway shipboard multibeam bathymetry, TSG, met and pCO2 data were collected and a flow-through cytometer was run.
The SADCP ran continuously.
The EK-80 ran during each cast.
There was also discrete underway sampling three times a day that included HPLC, POM, POC/N and DNA/RNA.
